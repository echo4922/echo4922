👋 Hi! I am Eddie Cho. I am a bioinformatician and obtained master’s in bioinformatics and medical informatics (BMI) at San Diego State University located in San Diego, California. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field where data science and biology are combined. Bioinformatics is fascinating because I like to analyze and find patterns using biological data. For my master’s thesis, I researched neural RNA-sequencing analysis of Drosophila melanogaster (common fruit fly) of how two different types of amyloid beta peptides affect neural gene expressions. Amyloid beta peptides have been known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease. I utilize Bash shell, Python and R to process complex sequencing data then create human readable format. Once processed, I analyze and create data visualizations. 

I set up my own system to understand better how a computer works.  I purchased a mini personal computer along with a solid-state drive to install a Debian based UNIX/LINUX, Ubuntu 22.04, “Jammy Jellyfish” with upgraded memories. I use Ubuntu to code and learn about Bioinformatics because there is so much to learn! And of course, it is fun as well.
